# HR Analytics Case Study in Power BI

I've just completed a fascinating HR Analytics case study in Power BI by DataCamp, focused on a fictional company named Atlas Labs. This project was packed with insights and gave me the opportunity to apply some advanced DAX concepts like the `USERELATIONSHIP` function, which I had learned but hadn't yet used in any projects.

## Key Insights

- **Total employees**: 1470, with an attrition rate of 16.1%.
- **Technology department** has the highest number of active employees.
- **Age group 20-29** has the most employees.
- **White ethnicity group** has the highest average salary.
- **Sales representatives** face a staggering attrition rate of 39.8%.
- **Frequent business travelers** have the highest attrition rate, with those working overtime also showing a high attrition rate of 30.5%.

These insights highlight critical areas for HR to focus on, from addressing high attrition rates in specific roles and demographics to understanding the impact of work conditions on employee retention.

I'm thrilled about the practical skills and knowledge Iâ€™ve gained through this case study and am eager to apply these insights to real-world scenarios!
